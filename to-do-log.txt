1. Fix discord message empty error that makes program quit completely
2. Bot decided to try to mine ancient debris block with lava nearby, fix it
3. Bot sometimes has trouble harvesting
4. Bot once got stuck on a block when moving
5. Bot doesn't seem to use alternate blocks / paths, do some more testing on this
 - Possible Solution: let user choose to skip some blocks
6. It was a pain in the butt to return to HQ later, so we should also program the mover module asap
