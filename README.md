4. npm install

## To do
2. Bot decided to try to mine ancient debris block with lava nearby, fix it
3. Bot sometimes has trouble harvesting as it just freezes, I think this is if the block is at head level and not at foot level?
 - Possible solution: limit the positions bot can be next to the block
4. Bot once got stuck on a block when moving
5. Bot doesn't seem to use alternate blocks / paths, do some more testing on this
 - Possible Solution: let user choose to skip some blocks
6. It was a pain in the butt to return to HQ later, so we should also program the mover module asap
